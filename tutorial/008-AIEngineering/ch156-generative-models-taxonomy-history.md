## The Problem

A generative model does one job: given training samples drawn from some unknown distribution `p_data(x)`, output new samples that look like they came from the same distribution. Faces, sentences, MIDI files, protein structures — all the same problem if you squint.

The rub is that `p_data` lives in a space with millions of dimensions (a 512x512 RGB image is ~786k dimensions), the samples sit on a thin manifold inside that space, and you only have maybe 10M examples. Brute-forcing the density is hopeless. Every generative model is a compromise that trades one hard problem for a slightly less hard one.

Five families have survived the last twelve years. Knowing which compromise each family makes tells you why it wins on some tasks and collapses on others.

## The Five Families

**1. Explicit density, tractable.** Write `log p(x)` as a sum you can actually evaluate. Autoregressive models (PixelCNN, WaveNet, GPT) factorize `p(x) = ∏ p(x_i | x_<i)`. Normalizing flows (RealNVP, Glow) build `p(x)` as an invertible transform of a simple base. Pro: exact likelihood, clean training loss. Con: autoregressive inference is sequential (slow for long sequences), flows need invertible architectures (architecturally restrictive).

**2. Explicit density, approximate.** Bound `log p(x)` from below (ELBO) and optimize the bound. VAEs (Kingma 2013) use an encoder-decoder with a variational posterior. Diffusion models (DDPM, Ho 2020) train a denoiser that implicitly optimizes a weighted ELBO. Diffusion is the dominant image, video, and 3D backbone in 2026.

**3. Implicit density.** Skip density entirely; learn a generator `G(z)` that produces samples and a discriminator `D(x)` that tells real from fake. GANs (Goodfellow 2014). Fast at inference (one forward pass) but notoriously unstable during training. StyleGAN 1/2/3 remain state of the art for fixed-domain photorealism (faces, bedrooms) even in 2026.

**4. Score-based / continuous-time.** Learn the gradient of the log-density `∇_x log p(x)` (the score) directly. Song & Ermon (2019) showed score matching generalizes diffusion to an SDE. Flow matching (Lipman 2023) is the 2024-2026 hotness: simulate-free training, straighter paths, 4-10x faster sampling than DDPM. Stable Diffusion 3, Flux, AudioCraft 2 all use flow matching.

**5. Token-based autoregressive over discrete codes.** Compress high-dim data with a VQ-VAE or residual quantizer into a short sequence of discrete tokens, then use a Transformer to model the token sequence. Parti, MuseNet, AudioLM, VALL-E, Sora's patch tokenizer all use this. This is bucket 1 plus a learned tokenizer.

## The Five-Question Triage

When a new generative model paper drops, answer these five questions before reading the method section.

1. **What is being modeled?** Pixels, latents, discrete tokens, 3D Gaussians, meshes, waveforms?
2. **Is the density explicit or implicit?** Do they write down `log p(x)`?
3. **Sampling: one-shot or iterative?** Iterative means slower inference; one-shot usually means adversarial or distilled.
4. **Conditioning: unconditional, class, text, image, pose?** This determines the loss and architecture scaffolding.
5. **Evaluation: FID, CLIP score, IS, human preference, task accuracy?** Each has known failure modes.

## Build It

The code for this lesson is a lightweight visualization: fit a 1-D mixture-of-Gaussians from samples using three toy approaches (kernel density, discrete histogram, and a nearest-sample "GAN-ish" generator) so you can see the difference between explicit vs implicit density.

```python
def histogram_density(samples, x, bin_width=0.25):
    """Explicit density via histogram. Returns p(x) as (count in bin) / (n * bin_width)."""
    n = len(samples)
    lo, hi = x - bin_width / 2, x + bin_width / 2
    count = sum(1 for s in samples if lo <= s < hi)
    return count / (n * bin_width)

def kde_density(samples, x, bandwidth=0.3):
    """Approximate density via Gaussian kernel density estimate."""
    n = len(samples)
    total = 0.0
    for s in samples:
        u = (x - s) / bandwidth
        total += math.exp(-0.5 * u * u) / math.sqrt(2 * math.pi)
    return total / (n * bandwidth)

def implicit_generator(samples, k, rng):
    """Implicit generator: sample a training point and add tiny noise. No p(x)."""
    out = []
    for _ in range(k):
        base = rng.choice(samples)
        out.append(base + rng.gauss(0.0, 0.1))
    return out
```

It draws 2000 samples from a two-mode Gaussian mixture, then prints:

```
explicit density (histogram): p(x in [-0.5, 0.5]) ≈ 0.38
approximate density (KDE):     p(x in [-0.5, 0.5]) ≈ 0.41
implicit (nearest-sample gen): 20 new samples printed, no p(x)
```

Notice: the first two let you ask "how likely is this point?" The third cannot. This is the *explicit vs implicit* distinction that will matter for every future lesson.

## Use It — Which Family for Which Task in 2026

| Task | Best family | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Photoreal faces, narrow domain | StyleGAN 2/3 | Still sharpest, fastest inference. |
| General text-to-image | Latent diffusion + flow matching | SD3, Flux.1, DALL-E 3. |
| Fast text-to-image | Rectified flow + distillation | SDXL-Turbo, SD3-Turbo, LCM. |
| Text-to-video | Diffusion Transformer + flow matching | Sora, Veo 2, Kling. |
| Speech + music | Token-based AR (AudioLM, VALL-E, MusicGen) or flow matching (AudioCraft 2) | Discrete tokens scale cheaply. |
| 3D scenes | Gaussian Splatting fit, diffusion prior | 3D-GS for reconstruction, diffusion for novel-view. |
| Density estimation (no sampling) | Flows | Only family with exact `log p(x)`. |
| Simulation / physics | Flow matching, score SDE | Straight-line paths, smooth vector fields. |

## Production Note — Five Families, Five Inference Shapes

- **Autoregressive (bucket 1 and 5).** Sequential decode dominates latency; KV-cache, continuous batching, and speculative decoding all apply directly.
- **VAE / diffusion / flow-matching (buckets 2 and 4).** Cost = `num_steps × step_cost`. The production knobs are step count (DDIM / DPM-Solver / distillation), batch size, and precision (bf16 / fp8 / int4).
- **GAN (bucket 3).** One forward pass. No schedule, no KV-cache. TTFT ≈ total latency.

## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Generative model | "It makes new stuff" | Learns a sampler for `p_data(x)`, optionally exposes `log p(x)`. |
| Explicit density | "You can evaluate it" | Model provides a closed-form or tractable `log p(x)`. |
| Implicit density | "GAN-style" | Only a sampler — no way to evaluate `p(x)` of a given point. |
| ELBO | "Evidence lower bound" | A tractable lower bound on `log p(x)`; VAEs and diffusion optimize it. |
| Score | "Gradient of log-density" | `∇_x log p(x)`; diffusion and SDE models learn this field. |
| Manifold hypothesis | "Data lives on a surface" | High-dim data concentrates on a low-dim manifold. |
| Autoregressive | "Predict the next piece" | Factorize joint as product of conditionals. |
| Latent | "Compressed code" | Low-dim representation from which a decoder can reconstruct the input. |

## Exercises

1. **Easy.** For each of these five products, identify the family and backbone: ChatGPT image, Midjourney v7, Sora, Runway Gen-3, ElevenLabs. Evidence should be from public technical reports.
2. **Medium.** The paper you are about to read tomorrow claims 100x faster sampling than diffusion. Write down three questions to check whether the speedup survives conditioning and high resolution.
3. **Hard.** Take one domain you care about (e.g. protein structure, CAD, molecules, trajectories). Answer the five-question triage for the current SOTA model in that domain and sketch what a better model would change.
