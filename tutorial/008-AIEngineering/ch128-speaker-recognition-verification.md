# Speaker Recognition & Verification

> ASR asks "what did they say?" Speaker recognition asks "who said it?" The math looks the same — embeddings plus cosine — but every production decision hinges on a single EER number.

**Type:** Build
**Languages:** Python
**Prerequisites:** Phase 6 · 02 (Spectrograms & Mel), Phase 5 · 22 (Embedding Models)
**Time:** ~45 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Build a speaker embedding from MFCC statistics and compute cosine similarity
- Implement the Equal Error Rate (EER) metric from same-speaker and different-speaker score distributions
- Use SpeechBrain's ECAPA-TDNN for production speaker verification
- Perform diarization with pyannote.audio 3.1

## The Problem

A user says a passphrase. You want to know: is this the person they claim to be (*verification*, 1:1), or is it the first person in your enrollment bank (*identification*, 1:N)? Or neither — is this an unknown speaker (*open-set*)?

The metric is **EER** — Equal Error Rate. Set your decision threshold so False Accept Rate = False Reject Rate. The crossover is EER.

## The Concept

**The pipeline.** Enrollment: record 5–30 seconds of the target speaker; compute a fixed-dimension embedding (192-d for ECAPA-TDNN, 256-d for WavLM-large). Verification: get the test utterance embedding; compute cosine similarity; compare to a threshold.

**ECAPA-TDNN (2020, still dominant 2026).** Emphasized Channel Attention, Propagation and Aggregation - Time-Delay Neural Network. 1D conv blocks with squeeze-excitation, multi-head attention pooling, followed by a linear layer to 192-d.

**WavLM-SV (2022+).** Fine-tune a pretrained WavLM-large SSL backbone with AAM loss. Higher quality but slower.

**x-vector (baseline).** TDNN + statistics pooling. Classic; still useful on CPU / edge.

### Scoring

- **Cosine** between enrollment and test embeddings.
- **PLDA (Probabilistic LDA).** Project embeddings into a latent space where same-speaker vs different-speaker has a closed-form likelihood ratio.
- **Score normalization.** `S-norm` or `AS-norm`: normalize each score against a cohort of imposter means and stds.

### Numbers you should know (2026)

| Model | VoxCeleb1-O EER | Params | Throughput (A100) |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| x-vector (classic) | 3.10% | 5 M | 400× RT |
| ECAPA-TDNN | 0.87% | 15 M | 200× RT |
| WavLM-SV large | 0.42% | 316 M | 20× RT |
| Pyannote 3.1 segmentation + embedding | 0.65% | 6 M | 100× RT |
| ReDimNet (2024) | 0.39% | 24 M | 100× RT |

### Diarization

"Who spoke when" in a multi-speaker clip. Pipeline: VAD → segment → embed each segment → cluster (agglomerative or spectral) → smooth boundaries. Modern stack: `pyannote.audio` 3.1.

## Build It

### Step 1: toy embedding from MFCC statistics

```python
import math

def embed_mfcc_stats(signal, sr):
    frames = featurize_mfcc(signal, sr, n_mfcc=13)
    mean = [sum(f[i] for f in frames) / len(frames) for i in range(13)]
    std = [
        math.sqrt(sum((f[i] - mean[i]) ** 2 for f in frames) / len(frames))
        for i in range(13)
    ]
    return mean + std  # 26-d
```

### Step 2: cosine similarity + threshold

```python
def cosine(a, b):
    dot = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(a, b))
    na = math.sqrt(sum(x * x for x in a))
    nb = math.sqrt(sum(x * x for x in b))
    return dot / (na * nb) if na and nb else 0.0

def verify(enroll, test, threshold=0.75):
    return cosine(enroll, test) >= threshold
```

### Step 3: EER from similarity pairs

```python
def eer(same_scores, diff_scores):
    thresholds = sorted(set(same_scores + diff_scores))
    best = (1.0, 1.0, 0.0)
    for t in thresholds:
        fr = sum(1 for s in same_scores if s < t) / len(same_scores)
        fa = sum(1 for s in diff_scores if s >= t) / len(diff_scores)
        if abs(fa - fr) < abs(best[0] - best[1]):
            best = (fa, fr, t)
    return (best[0] + best[1]) / 2, best[2]
```

### Step 4: production with SpeechBrain

```python
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderClassifier

clf = EncoderClassifier.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb")

enroll = torch.stack([clf.encode_batch(load(x)) for x in enrollment_clips]).mean(0)
score = clf.similarity(enroll, clf.encode_batch(load("test.wav"))).item()
verdict = score > 0.25
```

### Step 5: diarize with pyannote

```python
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline

pipe = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1")
diarization = pipe("meeting.wav", num_speakers=None)
for turn, _, speaker in diarization.itertracks(yield_label=True):
    print(f"{turn.start:.1f}–{turn.end:.1f}  {speaker}")
```

## Use It

The 2026 stack:

| Situation | Pick |
|-----------|------|
| Closed-set 1:1 verification, edge | ECAPA-TDNN + cosine threshold |
| Open-set verification, cloud | WavLM-SV + AS-norm |
| Diarization (meetings, podcasts) | `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` |
| Anti-spoofing (replay / deepfake detection) | AASIST or RawNet2 |
| Tiny embedded (KWS + enrollment) | Titanet-Small (NeMo) |

## Pitfalls

- **Channel mismatch.** Model trained on VoxCeleb (web video) ≠ phone-call audio.
- **Short utterances.** EER degrades sharply below 3 seconds of test audio.
- **Enrollment with noise.** One noisy enrollment poisons the anchor. Use ≥3 clean samples and average.
- **Fixed threshold across conditions.** Always tune the threshold on a held-out dev set.
- **Cosine on non-normalized embeddings.** L2-normalize first.

## Ship It

Save as `outputs/skill-speaker-verifier.md`. Pick model, enrollment protocol, threshold-tuning plan, and fraud safeguards.

## Exercises

1. **Easy.** Run `code/main.py`. Builds synthetic "speakers" (different tone profiles), enrolls, computes EER on a 100-pair trial list.
2. **Medium.** Use SpeechBrain ECAPA on 30 VoxCeleb1 utterances (5 speakers × 6 each). Compute EER with cosine vs PLDA.
3. **Hard.** Build the full enroll → diarize → verify pipeline with `pyannote.audio`. Evaluate DER on AMI dev set.

## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| EER | The headline metric | Threshold where False Accept = False Reject. |
| Verification | 1:1 | "Is this Alice?" |
| Identification | 1:N | "Who is speaking?" |
| Open-set | Unknown possible | Test set can contain unenrolled speakers. |
| Enrollment | Registering | Computing a speaker's reference embedding. |
| AAM-softmax | The loss | Softmax with additive angular margin; forces cluster separation. |
| PLDA | Classic scoring | Probabilistic LDA; likelihood-ratio scoring on top of embeddings. |
| DER | Diarization metric | Diarization Error Rate — miss + false alarm + confusion. |
