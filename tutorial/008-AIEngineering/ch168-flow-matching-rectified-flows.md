# Flow Matching & Rectified Flows

> Diffusion models take 20-50 sampling steps because they walk a curved path from noise to data. Flow matching (Lipman et al., 2023) and rectified flow (Liu et al., 2022) trained straight paths. Straighter paths mean fewer steps mean faster inference. Stable Diffusion 3, Flux.1, and AudioCraft 2 all switched to flow matching in 2024.

## The Problem

DDPM's reverse process is a 1000-step stochastic walk from `N(0, I)` back to the data distribution. DDIM collapsed it to 20-50 deterministic steps. You want fewer steps — ideally one. The blocker is that the ODE solving the reverse process is stiff; the path is curved.

If you could train the model such that the path from noise to data was a *straight line*, a single Euler step from `t=1` to `t=0` would work. Flow matching builds this directly: define a straight-line interpolation from `x_1 ∼ N(0, I)` to `x_0 ∼ data`, train a vector field `v_θ(x, t)` to match its time derivative, integrate at inference.

Rectified flow (Liu 2022) goes further: iteratively straighten the paths with a reflow procedure that produces a progressively closer-to-linear ODE. After two reflow iterations, a 2-step sampler matches 50-step DDPM quality.

## The Concept

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[x₁ ~ N0, I] -- t=1 --> B[Straight Line<br>x_t = (1-t)·x₀ + t·x₁]
    B -- t=0 --> C[x₀ ~ Data]
    B --> D[v_θ(x_t, t)]
    D --> E[Target: x₁ - x₀]
    A -- ODE solve --> F[Learned Vector Field]
    F -- 1 step --> C
```

### Straight-Line Flow

Define:

```
x_t = t · x_1 + (1 - t) · x_0,   t ∈ [0, 1]
```

where `x_0 ~ data` and `x_1 ~ N(0, I)`. The time derivative along this straight line is constant:

```
dx_t / dt = x_1 - x_0
```

Define a neural vector field `v_θ(x_t, t)` and train it to match this derivative:

```
L = E_{x_0, x_1, t} || v_θ(x_t, t) - (x_1 - x_0) ||²
```

This is the **conditional flow matching** loss (Lipman 2023). Training is simulation-free: you never unroll the ODE. Just sample `(x_0, x_1, t)` and regress.

### Sampling

At inference, integrate the learned vector field *backwards* in time:

```
x_{t-Δt} = x_t - Δt · v_θ(x_t, t)
```

Start at `x_1 ~ N(0, I)`, Euler-step down to `t=0`.

### Rectified Flow (Liu 2022)

1. Train flow model v_1 with random pairings.
2. Sample N pairs `(x_1, x_0)` by integrating v_1 from `x_1` to its landing `x_0`.
3. Train v_2 on those paired examples. Because the pairs are now "ODE-matched", the straight-line interpolant between them is genuinely flatter.
4. Repeat.

In practice 2 reflow iterations get you to near-linear, enabling 2-4 step inference.

### Why This Won for Images in 2024

1. **Simulation-free training** — no ODE unrolling during training, trivial to implement.
2. **Better loss geometry** — straight paths have consistent signal-to-noise.
3. **Faster inference** — 4-8 steps at SDXL-Turbo quality; 1 step with consistency distillation.

## Flow Matching vs DDPM

Flow matching with a Gaussian-conditional path is diffusion *with a specific noise schedule*. Pick the `x_t = α(t) x_0 + σ(t) x_1` schedule and flow matching recovers Stratonovich-reformulated diffusion with `v = α'·x_0 - σ'·x_1`. The two are algebraically equivalent for Gaussian paths.

What flow matching added: the *clarity* of the target (a plain velocity), a cleaner loss, and the license to experiment with non-Gaussian interpolants.

## Build It

`code/main.py` implements 1-D flow matching on a two-mode Gaussian mixture. The vector field `v_θ(x, t)` is a tiny MLP trained with the straight-line target.

### Step 1: training loss

```python
def train_step(x0, net, rng, lr):
    x1 = rng.gauss(0, 1)
    t = rng.random()
    x_t = t * x1 + (1 - t) * x0
    target = x1 - x0
    pred = net_forward(x_t, t)
    loss = (pred - target) ** 2
    # backprop + update
```

### Step 2: multi-step inference

```python
def sample(net, num_steps):
    x = rng.gauss(0, 1)
    for i in range(num_steps):
        t = 1.0 - i / num_steps
        dt = 1.0 / num_steps
        x -= dt * net_forward(x, t)
    return x
```

### Step 3: compare step counts

Expect the 4-step sampler to already match the 20-step quality — a big deal for latency.

## Pitfalls

- **Time parameterization.** Flow matching uses `t ∈ [0, 1]` with `t=0` at data, `t=1` at noise. DDPM uses `t ∈ [0, T]`.
- **Schedule choice.** Rectified flow's straight line is "the" flow-matching schedule, but you can use cosine or logit-normal t-sampling (SD3 does this) for better scale coverage.
- **Reflow cost.** Generating the paired dataset for reflow is a full inference pass per sample.
- **Classifier-free guidance still applies.** Just swap ε for v: `v_cfg = (1+w) v_cond - w v_uncond`.

## Production Note

Flux.1-schnell — a flow-matched DiT distilled to 1-4 inference steps while keeping Flux-dev-grade quality.

| Variant | Steps | Latency at 1024² on L4 | Total FLOPs (relative) |
|---------|-------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Flux.1-dev (raw) | 50 | ~15 s | 1.0× |
| Flux.1-schnell | 4 | ~1.2 s | 0.08× (12× faster) |

## Exercises

1. **Easy.** Run `code/main.py` and compare 1-step vs 20-step MSE vs the true data distribution.
2. **Medium.** Switch from uniform `t` sampling to logit-normal (concentrates sampling at mid-t). Does the model quality improve?
3. **Hard.** Implement one reflow iteration: generate paired (x_0, x_1) by integrating the first model, train a second model on the pairs, and compare 1-step sample quality.
